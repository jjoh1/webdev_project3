                <p>Not only is Hamilton non-stop, this song is. I enjoy how this song puts down a lot of Hamilton's story while also being extremely entertaining. I also really like the many references to earlier parts of the musical.</p>

            <p>After being intrigued by hearing the opening song from this musical, I discovered that I enjoy almost all of the songs included in it. While it shares many similarities to a concert rather than a musical, I still was extremely entertained by it.</p>
